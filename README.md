# Face_recognition_0

# What it does?

It greets the family members by recognizing their faces with their names. Ex: If i were to be at the front door it'd say "What's up Aktar Zaman"

## Twilio Feature

It sends a text to the homeowner about who's at the door.

# To do
* Trying to figure out how to send an actual face pic through the Twilio MMS. Look into this tutorial: https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/11/getting-started-with-opencv-and-python-featuring-the-martian-2.html
* Send a text message every 5 mins rather than keep on sending the same text over and over again so it'd wait a few moments before sending another text to the number. Look into: https://medium.com/@ageitgey/build-a-hardware-based-face-recognition-system-for-150-with-the-nvidia-jetson-nano-and-python-a25cb8c891fd.
* Want to incorporate all of that in Rasberry pi or Nvidia Jetsan Nano.
* have to hide the Twilio Account SID & Account Auth from the repo using env file.
